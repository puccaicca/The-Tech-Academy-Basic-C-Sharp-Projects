# The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp Projects
 
These are various C# and .NET Framework projects/assignments I made during my course at Academy of Learning

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Car Insurance</li>
 <li>Student Database</li>
</ul>

<h2>Car Insurance</h2>
<p>This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all the quotes that have been issued.</p>

<h2>Student Database</h2>
<p>This was using a Console Application with .NET Core. A simple code first console application that created a database, adding one student.</p>
